Easily create HTML objects via Javascript

HTML tags are valuable for creating HTML elements, view templates and nicely facilitate designer/developer handoff, it is sometimes easier to simply code an HTML element using javascript.  

Squares.js views all HTML elements (pages, divs, etc.) as simply a bunch of nested squares (well, ok rectangles) and thsu makes it easy to create and nest these squares (rectangels) from code.
