Easily create HTML objects via Javascript

HTML tags (HTML, DIV, IMG, SPAN etc) are valuable for creating HTML elements, MVC view templates and nicely facilitate designer/developer handoff.  While HTML tags are useful, it is sometimes easier to simply code an HTML element using javascript.  

Squares.js simplifies the way you think about HTML elements with the view that they are all simply a bunch squares nested inside of eachother (ok, they are actually rectangles).  

An \<img\> is a rectangle
A \<div\> is a rectangle
A \<form\> is a rectangle
An \<input\> is a rectangle

A Web page or a dynamic javascript control is simply is a bunch of these nested inside of eachother wich fancy stuff like rounded corners, or motion. 

Squares.js makes it easy to create and nest rectangles using pure javascript.  Helpful in creating dynamic, motion packed controls (think spin.js) or embedded in javascript frameworks (ie. a custom angular.js directive) without having to waste energy with DOM selectors.
