Easily create HTML objects via Javascript

HTML tags (HTML, DIV, IMG, SPAN etc) are valuable for creating HTML elements, MVC view templates and nicely facilitate designer/developer handoff.  While HTML tags are useful, it is sometimes easier to simply code an HTML element using javascript.  

Squares.js simplifies the way you think about HTML elements with the view that they are all simply a bunch of nested squares (ok, rectangles).  Squares.js makes it easy to create and next said squares.
